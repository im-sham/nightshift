# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Nightshift is in maintenance mode and currently supports:

- `0.2.x` (best-effort fixes)

Older versions are considered unsupported.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories:

- https://github.com/im-sham/nightshift/security/advisories/new

Do not open public GitHub issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Response Expectations

- Triage is best-effort (no guaranteed SLA).
- If validated, fixes may be released directly on `main` or through the next tagged patch/minor release.
- You may be asked to help validate fixes across your environment and OpenCode version.
